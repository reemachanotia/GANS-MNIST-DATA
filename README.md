GANs on MNIST Dataset


Overview
This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate handwritten digit images similar to those found in the MNIST dataset.

Requirements

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
Setup
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Create and activate a virtual environment.
Install the required packages using the provided requirements.txt file.
Dataset
The MNIST dataset will be automatically downloaded using your chosen deep learning library (TensorFlow or PyTorch).

Training
Run the training script located in the src/ directory. This script will train the GAN and save generated images and model checkpoints in the results/ directory.

Generate Images
After training, you can use the trained generator model to create new handwritten digit images. The generated images will be saved in the results/ directory for review.

Results
Generated images and model checkpoints are saved in the results/ directory.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how GANs can be used to generate realistic handwritten digit images. It serves as a foundational example for understanding GANs and their applications in image generation.
